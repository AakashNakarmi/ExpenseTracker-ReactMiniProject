# Expense-Tracker - Mini Project Using React

# Basic CRUD Application
1. Create a new expense and provide its description, amount and category through form
2. Read the data and display it in a tabular format and we can see the expenses according to the category as well
3. Delete a expense record

# My Learnings
1. Passing Data to Components using props
2. Taking input from form and schema based validation of forms using Zod
3. Updating Components State Data using useState
4. Filtering the record and displaying it
5. Event Listeners and its manipulation
6. Use of interfaces and components for loose-coupling and reusability
